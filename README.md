## Project Overview
This system employs collaborative AI agents to streamline product discovery and evaluation. It automates data collection, comparative analysis, price negotiation, and generates actionable reports for businesses.

## Key Features
- **Automated Research**: Web scraping/API integration with e-commerce platforms.
- **NLP-Powered Insights**: Sentiment analysis of product reviews.
- **Dynamic Negotiation**: API-driven deal hunting and coupon discovery.
- **Comparative Analytics**: ML-driven product scoring (price/quality/reliability).
- **Collaborative AI**: Agents work in tandem for optimized results.

---

## Agents
1. **Research Agent**  
   - Searches products across e-commerce platforms, forums, and review sites.
   - Collects pricing, specifications, ratings, and quality metrics.

2. **Comparator Agent**  
   - Analyzes data from the Research Agent.
   - Generates comparisons based on price, quality, reliability, and post-sale support.

3. **Negotiation Agent**  
   - Interfaces with e-commerce APIs to secure discounts/promotions.
   - Identifies coupons and special offers.

4. **Analytical Agent**  
   - Evaluates final datasets.
   - Generates detailed reports with ranked recommendations.

5. **Recommendation Agent**  
   - Delivers finalized reports to end-users.
   - Includes purchase links and rationale for top choices.

---

## Mechanisms
- **Automated Research**: Web scraping (e.g., Amazon, eBay) + API integrations.
- **NLP**: Sentiment analysis of textual reviews (Hugging Face/OpenAI).
- **Machine Learning**: Product classification and scoring models (PyTorch/TensorFlow).
- **Collaborative AI**: Agent coordination via LangChain/AgentGPT.

---

## Workflow
1. **Input Criteria**: Define product specs (budget, quality thresholds).
2. **Data Collection**: Research Agent gathers product data.
3. **Analysis Phase**: Comparator + Analytical Agents filter and rank products.
4. **Negotiation**: Negotiation Agent seeks discounts/promos.
5. **Reporting**: Recommendation Agent outputs final report with:
   - Top recommendations
   - Decision rationale
   - Purchase links
6. **Continuous Learning**: ML models improve over time.

## Technologies
- **AI Frameworks**:  
  - NLP: Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI
  - ML: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **APIs**: Amazon Product Advertising API, Google Search API
- **Agent Collaboration**: LangChain, AgentGPT
- **Tools**: Python, Beautiful Soup/Scrapy (web scraping), Pandas (data analysis)

---

## Benefits
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Savings**: Automates hours of manual research.
- üí∞ **Cost Reduction**: Identifies best value-for-money options.
- üìä **Transparency**: Clear, data-backed decision reports.
- üîß **Flexibility**: Adaptable to any product category.

---

## Example Usage
**Scenario**: Sourcing 4K monitors under $500  
1. Input criteria: `resolution=4K`, `max_price=$500`, `min_rating=4/5`.
2. System returns:
   - 3 top-rated monitors with price comparisons.
   - Identifies a 12% discount via Negotiation Agent.
   - Highlights "Monitor X" as best balance of price/quality.
